# User to Environment Mappings
# Maps GitHub usernames to DPC environment names
#
# Priority Order (highest to lowest):
# 1. environment_name in manifest metadata (explicit override)
# 2. User mapping from this file
# 3. Default environment
#
# Usage:
# - When a user pushes changes, the workflow looks up their GitHub username
# - If found in mappings below, that environment is used
# - If not found, the default environment is used
# - If manifest has environment_name, that always takes precedence

mappings:
  # Example mappings - add your GitHub usernames here
  # username: "environment_name"
  
# Default environment when no mapping found and no manifest override
default: "demo"
